# Head-Motion-Detection-Through-Earables

Head tracking is a fundamental component in visual attention
detection, which, in turn, can improve the state of the art
of hearing aid devices. A multitude of wearable devices for
the ear (so called earables) exist. Current devices lack a magnetometer
which, as we will show, represents a big challenge
when one tries to use them for accurate head tracking.
In this work we evaluate the performance of eSense, a
representative earable device, to track head rotations. By
leveraging two different streams (one per earbud) of inertial
data (from the accelerometer and the gyroscope), we achieve
an accuracy up to a few degrees. We further investigate the
interference generated by a magnetometer in an earable to
understand the barriers to its use in these types of devices.
